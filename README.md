#  LuxuryEvents - Guest List Manager

Welcome to **LuxuryEvents**, your one-stop guest management solution for organizing smooth, elegant events. This project is a simple **Event Guest List Manager** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focused on DOM manipulation and user interactivity without page reloads.

##  Project Description

LuxuryEvents lets users manage a list of guests attending an event. Users can:

* Submit guest names via a form.
* Assign a category to each guest (Friend, Family, Colleague, Neighbor).
* View guests on a dynamically updated list.
* Remove guests from the list.
* Toggle RSVP status with a confirmation alert.
* Limit the total guest count to 10.

This is a student project submitted as part of the **SA.02: Week 2 Code Challenge**.
